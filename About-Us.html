                <h1>Jason Contini</h1>
                <p>Jason is one of the Co-Founders of Archlight Entertainment along with longtime friend/brother Nicholas J. Hearne. 
                Jason began acting in regional summer stock theatre at the age of 3 portraying The Littlest Prince in Westport 
                Playhouse’s production of “The King and I”.  Since then, Jason has appeared on stage in over 100 theatrical 
                productions and has worked at such renowned theatres as The historic Muny in St. Louis, The St. Louis Opera 
                Company, Stages St. Louis, Imaginary Theatre Company (the children’s touring division of The St. Louis Repertory

                Repertory Theatre, Insight Theatre Company, Avalon Theatre, and others.  Having been a proud member of Actors 
                Equity since 2005, his favorite roles include Chris (“All My Sons”), Jesus (“Godspell”), Hornbeck (“Inherit The
                Wind”), Laertes (“Hamlet”), Macbeth (“Macbeth”), Bob Cratchit (“Bah Humbug”), Bill (“Oliver”), Matthew (“Cotton 
                Patch Gospel”), Jean (“Miss Julie”), Morris Townsend (“The Heiress”) and Happy Loman in “Death of a Salesman”, 
                a role which earned him a Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Award from The St. Louis Theatre Critic’s Circle.<br/><br/><br/>  
                Jason began working in film in 1999 with his film debut as the role of “bad influence” Phil in Bill Boll’s critically 
                acclaimed college drama “April is my Religion”.  Since then, Jason has appeared in over a dozen feature films and even 
                more shorts including Wyatt Weed’s Batman Fan Film “The Dark Knight Returns: An Epic Fan Film”, John Campea’s romantic 
                comedy “The Anniversary”, Eric Spudic’s horror comedy “Killers By Nature, Bobby Ray Akers’ holiday horror film “Thanxgiving”, 
                Mike Dorn’s look at celebrity “About a Girl” and as  dedicated vampire hunter Julian Van Hesse in Pirate Pictures’ and Wyatt 
                Weed’s critically acclaimed vampire thriller “Shadowland”.  Jason was also Co-Writer, Co-Producer and Co-Star of the 2016 
                family comic book drama “Four Color Eulogy”. <br/><br/><br/> 
                With Archlight Entertainment, Jason is developing two horror anthology films, an occupational drama, and a fan film 
                revolving around the Might Crusaders as writer and director.  He is also co-writer and director of the upcoming western 
                feature “Retribution” which Archlight will be teaming with Pirate Pictures to produce.  For Archlight Comics Jason has 
                teamed with Corey Leher  as the artist of their flagship title “The Untamed Adventures of T.A.I.L.S.” </p>

                <h1>Corey Leher</h1>
                <p>Corey Leher is Chief Executive Officer of Archlight Entertainment, and Head Writer of “The Untamed Adventures of T.A.I.L.S.”, the flagship
                comic series of Archlight Comics. Along with Co-founders Jason Contini and Nicholas J. Hearne, Corey helped launch Archlight Entertainment. 
                This came after Contini approached Corey to be a writer for the relaunch and rebranding of a comic series that Jason had attempted years prior. 
                When not executing the day-to-day logistics of running a company, Corey can be found contributing as a writer and producer to several of the 
                Archlight Entertainment upcoming projects, including “Devil’s Gun”, “Red Circle Investigations”, “Untamed Adventures of T.A.I.L.S.”, and 
                “Daughter of Wolves”.
                <br/><br/><br/>  
                Prior to Archlight Entertainment, Corey received his Master’s in Education from the University of Washington - Seattle, in Sports 
                Management, after having received his Bachelor’s in Arts from Westminster College in Fulton, where he majored in Transnational
                Politics, and minored in Anthropology and Sociology. Corey has lived all over the world, including Countries like Senegal, 
                Republic of Georgia, New Zealand, and his birth country of Zimbabwe. It is his experiences growing up, and his educational 
                background that has influenced a lot of his work, particularly T.A.I.L.S., that explores the issues such as discrimination and 
                prejudice. 
<               br/><br/><br/> 
                When not working at Archlight Entertainment, Corey is at home with his wife raising their first child Nathaniel. He loves Soccer, 
                and is a huge Manchester United fan. Corey also enjoys Dungeons and Dragons, Comics, Movies and Television, and can often be found 
                discussing the latest trends and events in the entertainment world. </p>
