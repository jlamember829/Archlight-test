                <h1>Jason Contini</h1>
                <p>Jason is one of the Co-Founders of Archlight Entertainment along with longtime friend/brother Nicholas J. Hearne. 
                Jason began acting in regional summer stock theatre at the age of 3 portraying The Littlest Prince in Westport 
                Playhouse’s production of “The King and I”.  Since then, Jason has appeared on stage in over 100 theatrical 
                productions and has worked at such renowned theatres as The historic Muny in St. Louis, The St. Louis Opera 
                Company, Stages St. Louis, Imaginary Theatre Company (the children’s touring division of The St. Louis Repertory 
                Theatre), Bluff City Theater, Okoboji Summer Theatre, St.. Louis Actors Studio, Upstream Theatre, Bankside

                Wind”), Laertes (“Hamlet”), Macbeth (“Macbeth”), Bob Cratchit (“Bah Humbug”), Bill (“Oliver”), Matthew (“Cotton 
                Patch Gospel”), Jean (“Miss Julie”), Morris Townsend (“The Heiress”) and Happy Loman in “Death of a Salesman”, 
                a role which earned him a Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Award from The St. Louis Theatre Critic’s Circle.<br/><br/><br/>  
                Jason began working in film in 1999 with his film debut as the role of “bad influence” Phil in Bill Boll’s critically 
                acclaimed college drama “April is my Religion”.  Since then, Jason has appeared in over a dozen feature films and even 
                more shorts including Wyatt Weed’s Batman Fan Film “The Dark Knight Returns: An Epic Fan Film”, John Campea’s romantic 
                comedy “The Anniversary”, Eric Spudic’s horror comedy “Killers By Nature, Bobby Ray Akers’ holiday horror film “Thanxgiving”, 
                Mike Dorn’s look at celebrity “About a Girl” and as  dedicated vampire hunter Julian Van Hesse in Pirate Pictures’ and Wyatt 
                Weed’s critically acclaimed vampire thriller “Shadowland”.  Jason was also Co-Writer, Co-Producer and Co-Star of the 2016

                feature “Retribution” which Archlight will be teaming with Pirate Pictures to produce.  For Archlight Comics Jason has 
                teamed with Corey Leher  as the artist of their flagship title “The Untamed Adventures of T.A.I.L.S.” </p>

                <h1>Nicholas J. Hearne</h1>
                <p>Blessed with an overactive imagination, Nicholas spent his early years absorbing as much pop culture as possible, assimilating the fundamentals of storytelling and story structure from television, films and comic books. He developed a love and respect for all genres and began crafting his own short stories and scripts that he would share with his friends and classmates. This creative outlet also led him to try his luck as an actor. From early adolescence to adulthood, Nicholas spent a great deal of his time honing his acting and writing skills, performing on both stage and screen across the Midwest.<br/><br/><br/>  
                Having tried his hand at writing and acting, Nicholas decided to see what things were like behind the camera, taking jobs as miscellaneous crew to learn as much as he could about the art of filmmaking. With exposure and experience in a little bit of everything, he became a "Jack of all trades, Master of none" go to guy when it came to the creative arts. This was due, in no small part, to his friendship with fellow local entertainer Jason Contini. It was this friendship and creative partnership with Jason that led Nicholas to explore many aspects of the performing arts and mingle with the local filmmaking community.<br/><br/><br/> 
                More recently, Nicholas and Jason have built up Archlight Entertainment, a St. Louis based production company specializing in filmmaking, video for hire, audio entertainment (podcasts) and comic books. Allowing himself to be available for anything, and doing his best to keep things moving along artistically, Nicholas has taken on the role of Creative Director inside the company. In the last few years they have completed a feature film, FOUR COLOR EULOGY, with the involvement of Pirate Pictures and have several other projects in varying stages of development.				
			    <br/><br/><br/> In between film and writing projects, Nicholas developed a flare for audio editing and podcasting. Working with several talented individuals through the 2GuysTalking Network, Nicholas is part of a variety of podcasts ranging from horror based, film reviews, comic books and more. Not only does he enjoy crafting the content, but he also has a zeal for helping others foster their own brand of programing.<br/><br/><br/>Throughout the years and his travels, Nicholas has met and worked with hundreds of creative and talented people. These relationships have allowed him to surround himself with professionals from all corners of the entertainment community, both far and wide. Because of this, Nicholas, along with Archlight Entertainment, is never in short supply when it comes to creativity and the drive for quality in all endeavors.

                <img src="assets/Corey.Headshot.jpg" alt="Corey Leher" width="400">
                <h1>Corey Leher</h1>
                <p>Corey Leher is Chief Executive Officer of Archlight Entertainment, and Head Writer of “The Untamed Adventures of T.A.I.L.S.”, the flagship
                comic series of Archlight Comics. Along with Co-founders Jason Contini and Nicholas J. Hearne, Corey helped launch Archlight Entertainment. 
                This came after Contini approached Corey to be a writer for the relaunch and rebranding of a comic series that Jason had attempted years prior. 
                When not executing the day-to-day logistics of running a company, Corey can be found contributing as a writer and producer to several of the 
                Archlight Entertainment upcoming projects, including “Devil’s Gun”, “Red Circle Investigations”, “Untamed Adventures of T.A.I.L.S.”, and 
                “Daughter of Wolves”.
                <br/><br/><br/>  
                Prior to Archlight Entertainment, Corey received his Master’s in Education from the University of Washington - Seattle, in Sports 
                Management, after having received his Bachelor’s in Arts from Westminster College in Fulton, where he majored in Transnational
                Politics, and minored in Anthropology and Sociology. Corey has lived all over the world, including Countries like Senegal, 
                Republic of Georgia, New Zealand, and his birth country of Zimbabwe. It is his experiences growing up, and his educational 
                background that has influenced a lot of his work, particularly T.A.I.L.S., that explores the issues such as discrimination and 
                prejudice. 
<               br/><br/><br/> 
                When not working at Archlight Entertainment, Corey is at home with his wife raising their first child Nathaniel. He loves Soccer, 
                and is a huge Manchester United fan. Corey also enjoys Dungeons and Dragons, Comics, Movies and Television, and can often be found 
                discussing the latest trends and events in the entertainment world. </p>
