                    Our in house film company is hard at work on several exciting projects. FOUR COLOR EULOGY (done in part with 
                    Pirate Pictures), our drama/comedy about the ties that bind a family and how pop culture can be used to deflect 
                    tragedy, is being re-released to a wider audience. KHYBER, a gritty 1980's war feature, is in the final stage of 
                    post-production. RETRIBUTION, a period piece set in the late 1800's, is looking to secure financing. And RED CIRCLE 
                    NVESTIGATIONS: A MIGHTY CRUSADERS FAN FILM, the first on film appearance of the MLJ Comics superheroes, is set to begin 
                    filming early 2020!

                ranging from all ages to mature audiences. With a small stable of creative artists and writers, the freedom of not having a

                everyone can enjoy something from Archlight Comics!</p>

                <h1>-UNTAMED ADVENTURES OF T.A.I.L.S.</h1>
                <p>When a strange substance turns a large portion of the worlds animal population into anthropomorphic super animals, an age of 
                    heroes dawns...and they're covered in fur! (Currently In Development)</p>

                <h1>-LEGACIES END</h1>
                <p>Superheroes are everywhere, but unlike the good old days, they are regulated and controlled by the government and corporations. 
                Some believe this is for the best, to protect civilians from harm and property damage. Others see it as the oppression of heroic 
                ideals started in a more innocent time. But when powered people are used for military might, the legacy of heroes may be nearing 
                its permanent end. (TBA)</p>

                <h1>-WHAT'S IN THE DARK</h1>
                <p>We all know that there's no reason to be afraid of the dark. However, we should be afraid of what's IN the dark!  The peaceful
                neighborhood located on Combs Street is about to learn this lesson first hand as the harmless shadows become thick with danger. No 
                man, woman, child or pet is safe from WHAT'S IN THE DARK. (TBA)</p>
