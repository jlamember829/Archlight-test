                <p>Archlight Comics is the comic book/graphic novel division of Archlight Entertainment, specializing in colorful storytelling 
                ranging from all ages to mature audiences. With a small stable of creative artists and writers, the freedom of not having a 
                major studio breathing down oneâ€™s neck allows for more time to let stories grow. Having both digital and print options available,
                everyone can enjoy something from Archlight Comics!</p>

                <h1>-UNTAMED ADVENTURES OF T.A.I.L.S.</h1>
                <p>When a strange substance turns a large portion of the worlds animal population into anthropomorphic super animals, an age of 
                    heroes dawns...and they're covered in fur! (Currently In Development)</p>

                <h1>-LEGACIES END</h1>
                <p>Superheroes are everywhere, but unlike the good old days, they are regulated and controlled by the government and corporations. 
                Some believe this is for the best, to protect civilians from harm and property damage. Others see it as the oppression of heroic 
                ideals started in a more innocent time. But when powered people are used for military might, the legacy of heroes may be nearing 
                its permanent end. (TBA)</p>

                <h1>-WHAT'S IN THE DARK</h1>
                <p>We all know that there's no reason to be afraid of the dark. However, we should be afraid of what's IN the dark!  The peacefully
                neighborhood located on Combs Street is about to learn this lesson first hand as the harmless shadows become thick with danger. No 
                man, woman, child or pet is safe from WHAT'S IN THE DARK. (TBA)</p>
